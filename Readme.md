# mypysky-web 

This is a fork of my python base game mypysky to run on browser using pygame-wasm 



*mypysky* is a personal attempt to learn python programming by creating a game using pygame library as well as creating an interactive playable fanart for my favorite mobile game - Sky children of light 

 
## How to play  

 Go to https://mitradranirban.github.io/mypysky-web
 After the game has loaded and "Ready to start!" is displayed - click on the screen

## Player control 

Press 'a' or Left arrow or touch '<' to go left 

Press 'd' or Right Arrow or touch '>' to go right

Press 'w' or Up arrow or touch "^" to jump

Touch '||' to stop 

Press 'q' or close window/ tab to quit

## Scoring 

Collect candles to increase scores 

Collect stars to increase health

Contact with crab, krill and stone will decrease your health - try to avoid them
